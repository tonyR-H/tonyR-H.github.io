# Hello world!

Hi, I'm Tony Ross-Hellauer, postdoctoral researcher in Open Science in the Social Computing research group, Know-Center, Graz, Austria. My main research interests are Open Science models and infrastructures, science policy, alternative models for peer review, and philosophy of technology. I have a PhD in Information Studies (University of Glasgow, 2012) in addition to MA (Philosophy) and MSc (Information and Library Studies) degrees. I have worked in a number of EU-funded projects on Open Access and data-sharing and am actively involved in Open Science advocacy and community-building. I am a three-time OpenCon alumni and a core member of Research Data Alliance Austria (Auditor) and Open Access Network Austria. As Scientific Manager for OpenAIRE at the University of Goettingen, I was responsible for OpenAIREâ€™s outreach strategy, scientific direction and coordination of its pan-European network of National Open Access Desks (NOADs). Find me on Twitter (too much) at [@tonyR_H](http://twitter.com/tonyR_H).
