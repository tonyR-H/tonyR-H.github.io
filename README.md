## About

Hi, I'm Tony Ross-Hellauer, postdoctoral researcher in Open Science in the Social Computing research group, [Know-Center](http://www.know-center.tugraz.at/en/), Graz, Austria. 

My main research interests are Open Science models and infrastructures, science policy, alternative models for peer review, and philosophy of technology. I have a PhD in Information Studies (University of Glasgow, 2012) in addition to MA (Philosophy) and MSc (Information and Library Studies) degrees. 

I have worked in a number of EU-funded projects on Open Access and data-sharing and am actively involved in Open Science advocacy and community-building. I am a three-time OpenCon alumni and a core member of [Research Data Alliance Austria](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-austria) (where I act as Auditor) and [Open Access Network Austria](http://www.oana.at/en/home/article/contactez-nous/). As Scientific Manager for [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) at the University of Goettingen, I was responsible for OpenAIREâ€™s outreach strategy, scientific direction and coordination of its pan-European network of National Open Access Desks (NOADs).
